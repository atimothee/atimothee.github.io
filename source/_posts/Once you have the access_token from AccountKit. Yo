Once you have the access_token from AccountKit. You need to pass it to your server and exchange it for a Firebase Custom token.

The server validates the AccountKit token by making a call to the AccountKit Graph API https://developers.facebook.com/docs/accountkit/graphapi which returns 

{  
   "id":"12345",
   "phone":{  
      "number":"+15551234567"
      "country_prefix": "1",
      "national_number": "5551234567"
   }
}

Then use Firebase server sdk to generate custom token.

Return that token back to phone and then login

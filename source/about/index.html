<article id='about'>
	<p>My name Timothy Asiimwe. I'm a software engineer living/working in Kampala. I'm the co-founder/CTO @ <a href="http://panya.ug">Panya</a>, a Ugandan startup, focused on building a chat-based platform for the best online services and products in Kampala.</p>

<p>This is where I come to share my thoughts, experiences, and hopefully help and/or inspire others. And if you’d like to say hello, you’re more than welcome to do so at "atimothee at gmail dot com".</p>

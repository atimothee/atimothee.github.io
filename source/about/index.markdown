description: "About Timothy Asiimwe"
---
My name Timothy Asiimwe. I'm a software engineer living/working in Kampala. I'm the co-founder/CTO @ [Panya](http://panya.ug), a Ugandan startup, focused on building a chat-based platform for the best online services & products in Kampala.

This is where I come to share my thoughts, experiences, and hopefully help and/or inspire others. And if you’d like to say hello, you’re more than welcome to do so at "atimothee at gmail dot com".
